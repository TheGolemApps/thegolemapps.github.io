        <h1>Privacy Policy - Fill The Grid</h1>
        <p>Fill The Grid is provided as a Freemium app. This SERVICE is offered at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
        <p>This page is used to inform users regarding our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decides to use our app.</p>

We do not collect personal data directly, but the app integrates third-party services (such as AdMob) that may collect data — including your device's Advertising ID — for the sole purpose of showing relevant ads, especially in regions where personalized advertising is supported.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information. However, Fill The Grid uses AdMob (Google) to display ads. In certain regions, AdMob may collect your device’s Advertising ID to serve personalized ads. This data collection is entirely managed by AdMob and is not stored or processed by us.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in providing your information and we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>This app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, we will immediately delete it. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take the necessary steps.</p>
