        <h1>Policy Statement</h1>
        <p>This app is provided as a Freemium app. This SERVICE is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in providing us with your personal information and strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.
